Zoterodactyl
============
Zoterodactyl is a set of Pentadactyl plugins that provide key mappings for [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org), so that common operations can be performed without entering passthrough mode.  `zotero_keys.js` provides mappings that work with basic Zotero.  `zutilo_keys.js` provides keys for the [Zutilo](https://github.com/willsALMANJ/Zutilo) plugin for Zotero.  

zotero_keys.js
--------------
* __<count>zf:__ Open the Zotero pane (if it is closed) and focus it.  If `<count>` is not given, focus the items pane.  For `<count>==1`, focus the search box.  For `<count>==2`, focus the collection pane (Mnemonic: "focus").

* __zc:__ Hide the Zotero pane.

* __zs:__ Create an item based on the content of the current page.

* __zN:__ Open the new item menu (to select the item type to create).

* __zw:__ Create a website item for the current page.

* __J:__ Select the next item in the collection (equivalent to `<Up>` in passthrough mode.).

* __K:__ Select the previous item in the collection (equivalent to `<Down>` in passthrough mode.).

* __):__ Select the next item in the collection while holding previous selection (equivalent to `<S-Up>` in passthrough mode.).

* __(:__ Select the previous item in the collection while holding previous selection (equivalent to `<S-Down>` in passthrough mode.).

* __zT:__ Toggle current Zotero item's children (attachments and notes) open and closed.

* __zP:__ Show paths of all attachments of selected Zotero items.

* __zM:__ Modify paths of all attachments of selected Zotero items.

* __zR:__ Relate selected Zotero items.

* __ze:__ Focus the info pane of selected Zotero item and then focus its first text box (Mnemonic: "edit").

* __zn:__ Add a new note to the current Zotero item.

* __zt:__ Focus the tags pane of selected Zotero item and then focus a new tag entry box.

* __z-R:__ Open the relate items dialog window for the currently selected Zotero item.

* __za:__ Attach the current page to the currently selected Zotero item.

* __zS:__ Create an item based on the content of the current page, using the opposite behavior for attaching associated files as is set in Zotero's preferences.

* __z-s:__ Create an item based on the content of the current page and attach associated files regardless of Zotero's preferences.

* __z-S:__ Create an item based on the content of the current page and do not attach associated files regardless of Zotero's preferences.

### Hints ###
* __z:__ Attach link target to the currently selected Zotero item.

Notes
-----
Pentadactyl catches some keystrokes (e.g. `<Down>` and `<Up>`), preventing them from being passed to Zotero (e.g. to select the next or previous item in the case of `<Down>` and `<Up>`).  The Zoterodactyl plugins try to create workarounds for these keystrokes (e.g. `J` and `K` for `<Down>` and `<Up>`).  Other keystrokes (e.g. `<Return>` and `<Del>`) are passed to Zotero when it has focus (e.g. so typing `zo` to focus Zotero allows one to open the currently selected item by pressing `<Return>` and to delete it by pressing `<Del>`).

Two of Zoterodactyl's key mappings conflict with default Pentadactyl key mappings (`zM` and `zR`).  Pentadactyl provides alternate default key mappings that can be used instead (`ZM` and `ZR`).

Install
-------
Install these plugins by copying them to the `~/.pentadactyl/plugins/` directory (or `%USERPROFILE%\pentadactyl\plugins` on Windows).  You have to create this directory if it does not exist. Any plugins in that directory will be loaded on start up. Plugins can also be loaded with the `:lpl` command.  If you modify the plugin and want to load it again, it may be necessary to use `:lpl!` to overwrite the previously loaded version.

The plugins need to be in a `plugins` directory of a directory in the `runtimepath` setting. If you want to use a different directory than `~/.pentadactyl`, you can add an additional directory to the `runtimepath` setting and save the plugins in a `plugins` subdirectory of it.
